# mtgcardsetter 
This is my own lite development for Magic: the Gathering community 
This code can support your liveview stream - it fast search and add any mtg card on your stream. 
You can add this files on your webserver with PHP 5.0 and higher support and use for OBS like a webpage. 
# How It Works? 
* Install local serever or use any webhosting. I prefer OpenServer (Basic): [https://ospanel.io/download/](https://ospanel.io/download/) 
* Copy project files on your server directory. With OpenServer it looks like a /domains/_yourhost.com_ 
* Start webserver 
* Open _yourhost.com_ in any browser (i recoimmend Google Chrome [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/))
